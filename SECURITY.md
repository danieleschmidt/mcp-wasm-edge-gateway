# Security Policy

## Overview

The MCP WASM Edge Gateway takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security-related information for users and contributors.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features

### Core Security

- **Memory Safety**: Written in Rust for memory-safe execution
- **Sandboxed Execution**: WASM runtime provides isolation
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling prevents information leakage

### Cryptographic Security

- **TLS 1.3**: All network communication uses modern TLS
- **Hardware Security**: TPM 2.0 integration for device attestation
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation, storage, and rotation
- **Digital Signatures**: Request/response signing for integrity

### Edge Security

- **Zero Trust**: All requests verified regardless of source
- **Device Attestation**: Hardware-backed device identity
- **Secure Boot**: Verification of software integrity
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest

## Threat Model

### Assets Protected

1. **ML Models**: Proprietary models and weights
2. **User Data**: Requests, responses, and personal information
3. **Device Identity**: Hardware attestation certificates
4. **Configuration**: Security policies and credentials
5. **System Resources**: CPU, memory, and storage

### Threat Actors

1. **Network Attackers**: Attempting to intercept or modify communications
2. **Malicious Models**: Compromised or backdoored ML models
3. **Physical Attackers**: Direct access to edge devices
4. **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies or build tools
5. **Insider Threats**: Malicious or compromised development/operations

### Attack Vectors

1. **Network-based**: Man-in-the-middle, replay attacks
2. **Code Injection**: Malicious input processing
3. **Side Channels**: Timing, power, or electromagnetic analysis
4. **Physical Access**: Device tampering or extraction
5. **Software Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies

## Security Controls

### Prevention

- **Secure Development**: Security code reviews and static analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions and capabilities
- **Secure Defaults**: Safe configuration out-of-the-box

### Detection

- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Intrusion Detection**: Anomaly detection and alerting
- **Integrity Monitoring**: File and configuration monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Resource usage tracking
- **Behavioral Analysis**: ML-based anomaly detection

### Response

- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incidents
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing capabilities
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continued operation under attack
- **Update Mechanism**: Secure and automated security updates
- **Forensics**: Evidence collection and analysis capabilities

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Process

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send details to: **security@terragon.ai**
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. We will work with you to understand and reproduce the issue
2. We will develop and test a fix
3. We will coordinate the timing of public disclosure
4. We will credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Configuration

### Recommended Settings

```toml
[security]
# Enable all security features
security_enabled = true
require_authentication = true
require_attestation = true
use_tpm = true
tls_min_version = "1.3"

# Audit logging
audit_enabled = true
audit_level = "detailed"
audit_retention_days = 90

# Network security
allowed_origins = ["https://trusted-domain.com"]
rate_limiting = true
max_requests_per_minute = 100
```

### Hardware Security

For maximum security on supported platforms:

```toml
[hardware_security]
# TPM configuration
use_tpm = true
tpm_device = "/dev/tpm0"
require_attestation = true
attestation_policy = "strict"

# Secure boot
verify_boot_chain = true
measured_boot = true

# Secure storage
encrypt_at_rest = true
key_derivation = "hardware"
```

## Security Monitoring

### Metrics to Monitor

- Authentication failures
- Attestation failures
- Unusual request patterns
- Resource exhaustion
- Model performance anomalies
- Network connection anomalies

### Alerting Rules

```yaml
# High authentication failure rate
- alert: HighAuthFailureRate
  expr: rate(mcp_auth_failures_total[5m]) > 0.1
  
# TPM attestation failures
- alert: AttestationFailure
  expr: mcp_attestation_failures_total > 0
  
# Unusual model behavior
- alert: ModelAnomalyDetected
  expr: mcp_model_anomaly_score > 0.8
```

## Compliance

### Standards

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Core security practices
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **Common Criteria**: Security evaluation standards
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls

### Certifications
