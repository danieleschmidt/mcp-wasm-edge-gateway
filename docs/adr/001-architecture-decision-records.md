# ADR-001: Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a systematic way to document architectural decisions for the MCP WASM Edge Gateway project. As the project grows and involves multiple contributors, it's crucial to maintain a record of key technical decisions, their rationale, and their consequences.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. Each ADR will follow a standard format and be stored in the `docs/adr/` directory.

## Rationale
- **Transparency**: All team members and contributors can understand why certain decisions were made
- **History**: Preserve the reasoning behind decisions for future reference
- **Accountability**: Clear ownership and justification for architectural choices
- **Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the project's evolution
- **Review**: Enable better architectural reviews and retrospectives

## Consequences
### Positive
- Better documentation of architectural decisions
- Improved team communication and alignment
- Easier onboarding for new contributors
- Historical context for future decisions
- Support for architectural reviews

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Need to maintain and update ADRs
- Risk of ADRs becoming outdated

## Implementation
1. Create ADR template in `docs/adr/template.md`
2. Number ADRs sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
3. Require ADRs for significant architectural decisions
4. Review ADRs as part of the code review process
5. Update existing ADRs when decisions change

## ADR Format
Each ADR will include:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: Background and problem statement
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Rationale**: Why we made this decision
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
- **Implementation**: How to implement the decision

## Review Process
1. Create ADR as part of feature/architecture proposal
2. Team review and discussion
3. Approval by lead architect
4. Implementation tracking
5. Regular review and updates
