# GitHub Actions Workflows - Manual Setup Required

## ⚠️ Important Notice

Due to GitHub App permission limitations, the 7 comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows must be added manually to the `.github/workflows/` directory. These workflows provide enterprise-grade CI/CD automation.

## 📋 Required Manual Setup Steps

### 1. Create Workflow Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### 2. Copy Workflow Files

The complete workflow implementations are documented in [docs/workflows/ci-cd-complete.md](workflows/ci-cd-complete.md). You need to create these 7 workflow files:

#### Core Workflows
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Comprehensive CI pipeline
- **`.github/workflows/security.yml`** - Multi-layer security scanning  
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Automated release management
- **`.github/workflows/docs.yml`** - Documentation deployment
- **`.github/workflows/monitoring.yml`** - Production monitoring
- **`.github/workflows/performance.yml`** - Performance testing
- **`.github/workflows/modernization.yml`** - Monthly analysis

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

#### Repository Secrets (Required)
```bash
# Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
# Add these secrets:
```
- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` - For crates.io publishing
- `PRODUCTION_API_KEY` - For production monitoring
- `MONITORING_WEBHOOK` - For alert integrations

#### Branch Protection Rules
```yaml
# Settings > Branches > Add rule for 'main'
required_status_checks:
  - "Check"
  - "Test Suite"
  - "Clippy" 
  - "Security Audit"
enforce_admins: true
required_pull_request_reviews:
  required_approving_review_count: 1
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
```

#### Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to Settings > Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Documentation will auto-deploy

### 4. Team Configuration

Set up these teams for CODEOWNERS:
- `@terragon-labs/maintainers`
- `@terragon-labs/security-team`
- `@terragon-labs/docs-team`
- `@terragon-labs/core-team`
- `@terragon-labs/wasm-team`
- `@terragon-labs/infrastructure-team`
- `@terragon-labs/devops-team`
- `@terragon-labs/observability-team`
- `@terragon-labs/release-team`

- Changelog generation using git-cliff
- GitHub release creation with artifacts

### 4. Documentation (`docs.yml`)
- API documentation generation with cargo doc
- mdBook integration for comprehensive documentation
- GitHub Pages deployment automation
- Link checking for documentation quality
- Automated deployment on documentation changes

### 5. Production Monitoring (`monitoring.yml`)
- Health checks every 6 hours for production endpoints
- Load testing with Artillery and performance thresholds  
- Security monitoring with advisory database checks
- Repository metrics collection and trend analysis
- Automated alerting for health and performance issues

### 6. Performance Testing (`performance.yml`)
- Automated benchmarking with regression detection (110% threshold)
- Memory profiling using Valgrind
- WASM binary size tracking (<3MB threshold)
- Cross-platform performance validation
- Binary size regression checks with platform-specific limits

### 7. Modernization Analysis (`modernization.yml`)
- Monthly dependency health assessment
- Rust edition upgrade analysis
- Security best practices audit
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Technical debt assessment with actionable recommendations

## 📊 Expected Impact After Setup

## 🔧 Quick Setup Commands

```bash
# 1. Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# 2. Copy workflow content from docs/workflows/ci-cd-complete.md
# to individual .yml files in .github/workflows/

# 3. Commit and push workflows
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "feat: Add comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows"
git push

# 4. Configure repository settings as described above
```
