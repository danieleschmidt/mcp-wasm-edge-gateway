## üö¶ Next Steps & Manual Setup Required

### Immediate Actions (Manual Setup Required)

1. **Add GitHub Actions Workflows**
   ```bash
   # Create workflow directory
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   
   # Copy workflow files from docs/workflows/ci-cd-complete.md
   # to .github/workflows/ directory
   ```

2. **Configure Repository Secrets**
   - `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` - For crates.io publishing
   - `PRODUCTION_API_KEY` - For production monitoring
   - `MONITORING_WEBHOOK` - For alert integrations

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - Documentation will auto-deploy on main branch changes

4. **Set Branch Protection Rules**
   - Require status checks: "Check", "Test Suite", "Clippy", "Security Audit"
   - Require pull request reviews (1 approver minimum)
   - Dismiss stale reviews on new commits

### Recommended Configuration

#### GitHub Repository Settings
```yaml
# Branch protection for main
required_status_checks:
  - "Check"
  - "Test Suite" 
  - "Clippy"
  - "Security Audit"
enforce_admins: true
required_pull_request_reviews:
  required_approving_review_count: 1
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
```

#### Team Assignments
- **@terragon-labs/maintainers**: Code review and releases
